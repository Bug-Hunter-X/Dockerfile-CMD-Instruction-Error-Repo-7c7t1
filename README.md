This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: the incorrect use of the CMD instruction when combining multiple commands. The original Dockerfile attempts to install dependencies and then run the application within a single CMD instruction. This results in the pip install command's output interfering with the subsequent execution of the python script.  The solution demonstrates the correct way to sequence these commands, using shell form to chain them or separating them using multiple CMD/ENTRYPOINT directives.
